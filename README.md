# SQL Project

> This project will test the student’s domain of SQL queries by requesting them to retrieve and organize different pieces of data from a table.

Go to [SQL Zoo](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Main_Page) and do Tutorials 0-9 listed under the “Tutorial Section” and the quizzes listed at the end of each. The first is the [“Select” tutorial](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_basics). Make sure the dropdown on the upper right of the main page for “Engine” says “MySQL” (the default). Large results will be cut off and not all rows or columns shown, so the “answers” may not look 100% correct.
